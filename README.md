# ultimate-react-course
Starting today, August 22, 2024, I am enrolled in "The Ultimate React Course 2024: React, Next.js, Redux & More" by Jonas Schmedtmann. My goal is to complete this course and become a better Frontend Developer.

Previously, I completed the Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certificate as a foundation course in frontend development. The reason I chose to take Jonas' course is because I want to take the knowledge I gained from the Meta course to the next level.
