## Commit to At Least 85 Hours of Learning

Don't just watch the lecturesâ€”dive straight into live coding. Type every letter the instructor types as they type it. After each lecture, review what you've written, and then explain to a "rubber duck" why the code works. Why did the instructor make certain decisions? What happens when you change things around? Remember, true learning happens only when you're building something.

### Programming is About Action, Not Just Theory

By immersing yourself in live coding, you'll experience the challenges and satisfaction of creating something from scratch. Every mistake is a step forward towards deeper understanding. Don't be afraid to try new things, as that's where your creativity will truly flourish.

### Build Your Inner Motivation

Don't stop until you've mastered the material. With a strong mindset and unwavering determination, you can reach extraordinary levels of expertise. Every hour you invest brings you closer to your goal. Make every second of your learning journey count!
