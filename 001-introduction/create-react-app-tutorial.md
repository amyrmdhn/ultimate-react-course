# Tutorial: Let's get started with creating a React project with Create React App!

This tutorial will walk you through the steps of setting up a React project using create-react-app. This tool makes it easier for you to get set up, so you can focus on building your app.

Before you get started, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js** (version 18 or higher)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager) or **yarn** (optional, but recommended) <br><br>

Open a terminal and navigate to the folder where you'll save the React project. <br>
Then just type in the following command:

```bash
npx create-react-app project-name
```

Then open up the React project folder in your code editor. That's it! Your project is ready to go with CRA.
